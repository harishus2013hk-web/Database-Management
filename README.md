This repository showcases essential SQL control and aggregation techniques used in real-world data analysis:
- CASE WHEN: Conditional logic for dynamic column values and categorization.
- IF-ELSE (MySQL): Inline decision-making for binary conditions and branching logic.
- GROUP BY: Aggregates data by categories to compute metrics like SUM, AVG, COUNT.
- WHERE: Filters rows based on specific conditions to refine query results.
- ORDER BY: Sorts query results by one or more columns in ascending or descending order, enabling ranked outputs, chronological listings, and prioritized views.
