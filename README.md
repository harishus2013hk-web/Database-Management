This repository showcases essential SQL control and aggregation techniques used in real-world data analysis:
DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. Common DDL statements include:
- CREATE – to create new tables, schemas, or other database objects
- ALTER – to modify existing table structures or constraints
- DROP – to delete tables or other objects permanently
- TRUNCATE – to quickly remove all data from a table while keeping its structure
- RENAME – to change the name of a table or column
  
- CASE WHEN: Conditional logic for dynamic column values and categorization.
- IF-ELSE (MySQL): Inline decision-making for binary conditions and branching logic.
- GROUP BY: Aggregates data by categories to compute metrics like SUM, AVG, COUNT.
- WHERE: Filters rows based on specific conditions to refine query results.
- ORDER BY: Sorts query results by one or more columns in ascending or descending order, enabling ranked outputs, chronological listings, and prioritized views.
